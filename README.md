# Image Augmentation and Training for Road Sign Classification

This project consists of two Python scripts designed for image augmentation and training a neural network on the augmented road sign images.

## Installation

To run the scripts, you need to have Python installed along with the following packages:

- `numpy`
- `PIL` (Pillow)
- `opencv-python`
- `tqdm`
- `tensorflow`
- `keras`
- `imblearn`

You can install the required packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install numpy pillow opencv-python tqdm tensorflow keras imblearn


## Usage

- If you are using an Apple device, it needs to have the M1 chip or later to efficiently run the code. Windows 10 or 11 is reccomended
- Make sure that the augmetended images are in a directiory called augmented_images
- Make sure that the original dataset is in a directory called images
- Make sure that the annotations from the dataset are in a directory called annotations
